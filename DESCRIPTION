Description: This package implements choice models based on economic theory, and provides a tidyverse-inspired interface to running the related MCMC-samplers. Models include versions of the Hierarchical Multinomial Logit and Multiple Discrete-Continous (Volumetric) models with and without screening. The foundations of these models are described in Allenby, Hardt and Rossi (2019)  <doi: 10.1016/bs.hem.2019.04.002>. Models with conjunctive screening are described in Kim, Hardt, Kim and Allenby (2022) <doi: 10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.04.001>. Models with set-size variation are described in Hardt and Kurz (2020) <doi: 10.2139/ssrn.3418383>.
