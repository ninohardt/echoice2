Description: Implements choice models based on economic theory, including
    estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), prediction, and
    more. Its usability is inspired by ideas from 'tidyverse'. Models
    include versions of the Hierarchical Multinomial Logit and Multiple
    Discrete-Continous (Volumetric) models with and without screening. The
    foundations of these models are described in Allenby, Hardt and Rossi
    (2019) <doi:10.1016/bs.hem.2019.04.002>. Models with conjunctive
    screening are described in Kim, Hardt, Kim and Allenby (2022)
    <doi:10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.04.001>. Models with set-size variation
    are described in Hardt and Kurz (2020) <doi:10.2139/ssrn.3418383>.
