## Overview

This package contains choice models with economic foundation.
Its purpose is to simplify using choice models with economic foundation.
Key tenets are: (1) Simple, flexible data handling that is compatible with R-tidyverse and general enough to support many different models (2) speed.

For more theoretical background and reasons to use choice models with economic foundation, please refer to the chapter '[Economic foundations of conjoint analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.hem.2019.04.002)' in the [Handbook of the Economics of Marketing](https://www.elsevier.com/books/handbook-of-the-economics-of-marketing/dube/978-0-444-63759-8).

For details and examples on how to use echoice, please refer to the [vignette](http://ninohardt.de/echoice2/articles/echoice2.html) in the package.
It illustrates model estimation, predictions and model evaluation.

All key functions are written in c++ and use [openMP](https://www.openmp.org) for multi-threaded computing.
C++ integration in R is facilitated by [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org).

`echoice2` (largely) follows tidy principles and integrated nicely with `dplyr`.
It can be used to generate choice volume/share simulators, though no front-end is built into the package yet.

`echoice2` is a complete rewrite of the original `echoice` package, which is still available on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ninohardt/echoice).

## News

-   `Conjunctive Screening in Models of Multiple Discreteness' is going to be published. The volumetric screening model is easy to apply. Check out this [example](https://github.com/ninohardt/echoice2/blob/main/man/html/echoice2_pizza.html) (3/22/22)

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")

#Turn off warning-error-conversion, because the tiniest warning stops installation
Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = "true")

#install from github
remotes::install_github("ninohardt/echoice2")

#install from github and compile/include vingette
remotes::install_github("ninohardt/echoice2", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Installation notes

-   Make sure you are using a recent R4.0.x version, `tidyerse`, `Rcpp` and `RcppArmadillo` before building the package from Github.

-   If you use Linux it should just work.
    If not, you might need to install libgomp before compilation.

-   If you are using OSX, you may have to install CLI, XQuartz and potentially other things that Apple removed from OSX.
    Google '+OSX +Rcpp' if you run into trouble.

-   If you are using Windows, install [Rtools](<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)> first.

### Binaries

Binaries are made available with [releases](https://github.com/ninohardt/echoice2/releases) (under 'Assets').

You can install the binary version from the 'Packages' tab in RStudio.
Select 'Install' and change 'Install from' to 'Package Archive File'.
Or you use `install.packages` on the command line and point it to the downloaded .zip file.

## Functionality

The following models are implemented (including estimation and prediction):

-   Discrete Choice (HMNL)
-   Discrete Choice, attribute-based screening (not including price)
-   Discrete Choice, attribute-based screening (including price)
-   Volumetric demand, EV1 errors
-   Volumetric demand, Normal errors
-   Volumetric demand, attribute-based screening, Normal errors
-   Volumetric demand, attribute-based screening including price, Normal errors
-   Volumetric demand, accounting for set-size variation (1st order), EV1 errors
-   Volumetric demand, accounting for set-size variation (2nd order), EV1 errors

## Usage

Please read the vignette.
It illustrates a complete workflow from estimation to market simulation.
The vignette can also be found on the [package website](http://ninohardt.de/echoice2/articles/echoice2.html).

Functions that relate to discrete demand start in `dd_`, while functions for volumetric demand start in `vd_`.
Universal functions (discrete and volumetric choice) start in `ec_`.
Estimation functions continue in `est`, demand simulators in `dem.`

The package comes with a small example dataset `icecream` from a volumetric conjoint study.
It contains 300 respondents.

```{r}
  data(icecream)
  icecream %>% head
```

Choice data data.frames or tibbles need to contain the following columns:

-   `id` (integer; respondent identifier)
-   `task` (integer; task number)
-   `alt` (integer; alternative number within task)
-   `x` (double; quantity purchased)
-   `p` (double; price)
-   attributes defining the choice alternatives (factor, and soon continuous as well)

While this requires a little extra space for discrete choice data, it simplifies the workflow and makes the package versatile.
It can be applied to data from choice experiments and purchase histories.
It allows variance in the number of choice tasks per subject, and variance in the number of choice alternatives per task.

Estimating a simple volumetric demand model is easy.
Use the `vd_est_vdm` function, and use at least 100,000 draws:

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
est_icecream <- icecream %>% vd_est_vdm(R=10000)
```

Upper-level estimates can be summarized using `ec_estimates_MU`:

```{r}
est_icecream %>% ec_estimates_MU()
```

Corresponding demand predictions can be obtained using the `vd_dem_vdm` function.
Here, we generate in-sample predictions:

```{r}
dempres_icecream <-
  icecream %>%
  vd_dem_vdm(est = est_icecream)
```

The resulting output makes it easy to work with demand predictions without obtaining posterior means too early.
Demand prediction draws are stored in a single column `.demdraws`.

```{r}
dempres_icecream
```

We can aggregate (e.g., by subject `id`) using `ec_dem_aggregate`:

```{r}
dempres_icecream %>% 
  ec_dem_aggregate('id')
```

Once we have the desired aggregation level, we can obtain summaries (e.g., posterior means) using `ec_dem_summarise`

```{r}
dempres_icecream %>% 
  ec_dem_aggregate('id') %>%
  ec_dem_summarise()
```

Both `ec_dem_aggregate` and `ec_dem_summarise` simply apply common `dplyr` and `purrr` functions.
